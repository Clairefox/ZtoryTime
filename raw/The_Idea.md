<h2>Gist of this Project</h2>
Ztories are text-based "choose your own adventure" stories presented on a website
that can save "reader" progress and choices.

<h2>Project Attitude</h2>
*   Transparency is vital
*   No erotic content (that can be a separate project)

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
*   Content is available to be viewed in its entirety before playing.
    *   This helps users decide whether or not a ztory is for them.
    *  
*   Saves can be downloaded if a user wants to keep progress between sessions. 
    *   Saves will NOT be saved server-side.
    *   These files will be easy-to-understand and show all choices made so far and, if calculated, any "ztory reader stats" used to track outcomes of a ztory. 
    *   Null stats will not show on a save file, save some memory!
    *   Code needs to be self-healing, within reason, if save files are manipulated by a user.
*   "Pages" need to be screen-reader friendly.
*   All Ztories will have posted trigger warnings in their description.
