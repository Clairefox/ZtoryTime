Future Carla,

When you're feeling like wanting to plan even further into the future
about this and then you start complicating things beyond 'right now',
I want you to remember that this is for yourself. Because you love 
creating things and love a good story <3

Mayyyyyybeeeeee soooooooomedaaaaay, we can get Mark Cuban or whoever to
back this project and we can break away from the 9 to 5! But until then,
let's just enjoy the process and where we are currently. Because, writing
this note to you, future me, I'm looking at all uphill. Don't forget to
turn around and be proud of how you got there.

Love,
Past Carla
